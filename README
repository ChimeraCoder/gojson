gojson
===========

gojson is a simple command-line tool for generating go structs for existing JSON documents.


Example
----------

Given a file json_example.json (or stdin) which contains some sample JSON data, gojson will generate a valid Go struct definition and infer the appropriate types.

```sh
$ curl -s https://raw.github.com/ChimeraCoder/gojson/master/json_example.json | gojson
package main

type JsonStruct struct {
	_comment	string
	Glossary	struct {
		GlossDiv	struct {
			GlossList	struct {
				GlossEntry struct {
					Abbrev		string
					Acronym		string
					GlossDef	struct {
						GlossSeeAlso	[]string
						Para		string
					}
					GlossSee	string
					GlossTerm	string
					ID		string
					SortAs		string
				}
			}
			Title	string
		}
		Title	string
	}
}
```

Installation
----------

Assuming you have a go environment set up:

```sh
$ go get github.com/ChimeraCoder/gojson
```

gojson should now be on your path (in $GOPATH/bin or $GOROOT/bin)

License 
----------

gojson is free software distributed under Version 3 of the GNU Public License. 

As of the time of writing, this is the same license used for gcc (and therefore gccgo), so it is unlikely to restrict use in any way. Note that the GPL does not extend to any output generated by gojson; the GPL only applies to software which includes copies of gojson itself.
